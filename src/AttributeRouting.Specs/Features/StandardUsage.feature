Feature: Standard Usage

Scenario Outline: Generating routes for an MVC controller
	Given I have registered the routes for the StandardUsageController
	When I fetch the routes for the StandardUsageController's <action> action
	Then the route is constrained to <method> requests
	 And the route url is "<url>"
	 And the default for "controller" is "StandardUsage"
	 And the default for "action" is "<action>"
	 And the namespace is "AttributeRouting.Specs.Subjects"
	 And the route has a data token for "actionMethod"
	
	Examples:
		| method | action        | url                   |
		| GET    | Index         |                       |
		| HEAD   | Index         |                       |
		| POST   | Create        | Create                |
		| PUT    | Update        | Update/{id}           |
		| DELETE | Destroy       | Destroy/{id}          |
		| GET    | Wildcards     | Wildcards/{*pathInfo} |
		|        | AnyVerb       | AnyVerb               |
		# The URL when using the default ctor should simply be the action name
		| GET    | GetDefault    | GetDefault            |
		| HEAD   | GetDefault    | GetDefault            |
		| PUT    | PutDefault    | PutDefault            |
		| POST   | PostDefault   | PostDefault           |
		| DELETE | DeleteDefault | DeleteDefault         |
		|        | RouteDefault  | RouteDefault          |

Scenario Outline: Generating routes for an API controller
	Given I have registered the routes for the HttpStandardUsageController
	When I fetch the routes for the HttpStandardUsage controller's <action> action
	Then the route is constrained to <method> requests
	 And the route url is "<url>"
	 And the default for "controller" is "HttpStandardUsage"
	 And the default for "action" is "<action>"
	 And the namespace is "AttributeRouting.Specs.Subjects.Http"
	 And the route has a data token for "actionMethod"
	
	Examples:
		| method  | action        | url                       |
		| GET     | Get           | api                       |
		| HEAD    | Get           | api                       |
		| OPTIONS | Get           | api                       |
		| POST    | Post          | api                       |
		| OPTIONS | Post          | api                       |
		| PUT     | Put           | api/{id}                  |
		| OPTIONS | Put           | api/{id}                  |
		| DELETE  | Delete        | api/{id}                  |
		| OPTIONS | Delete        | api/{id}                  |
		| GET     | Wildcards     | api/Wildcards/{*pathInfo} |
		|         | AnyVerb       | api/AnyVerb               |
